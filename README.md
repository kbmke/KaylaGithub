## Why this project
----------------------
This project is a portfolio with some of the things that I have completed (with photos) while I was in the YWeb Cohort 16, from February 2022 until June 2022. I have included my photo, resume, and skills as well. I am still new to coding and am still learning but also so excited to have found something that I really enjoy doing!

### The Gallery

Here in the gallery are some projects that I did while in the Cohort 16 program.

They were from the [website](http://frontendmentor.com)

I did quite a bit more than this but picked just a few to put on here. I plan on making another portfolio to keep track of and up to date with all of items that I've worked on.


The phone image at the bottom next to my contact information is from the [website](http://pexels.com), which I then imported into the app **Procreate** and then removed the background and resized the image before saving it to my picture folder here.
