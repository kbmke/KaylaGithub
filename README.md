This project is a portfolio with some of the things that I have completed (with photos) while I was in the YWeb Cohort 16, from February 2022 until June 2022. I have included my photo, resume, and skills as well. I am still new to coding and am still learning but also so excited to have found something that I really enjoy doing!
